# Fib Like
Write a function to output a Fibonacci-like series of `n` digits. Each number in the series is the sum of the previous two numbers.

```js
let n = 5

fibLike(10, 20, n)
[10, 20, 30, 50, 80]

fibLike(3, 7, n)
[3, 7, 10, 17, 27]
```

Extra credit: Given a sequence, determine if the sequence is “fibonacci-like”.
